# VRData Data

# Version 2.2

Data updates after the June 2021 runs used in the published VB Report.

* Apr 1, 2022 `PSSteelheadSR2020.csv` Green River had two 2019 entries. The 972 is correct. Elwha River fracwild is not 1. Much less. Updated to correct values.
* March 4, 2022 `LCchinook2020.csv` Remove pop 19 2009-2019, Cascade fall,Sandy River, this is actually pop 20, Cascade late fall,Sandy River, which had stopped in 2008. With that fixed, pop 20, Cascade late fall,Sandy River, goes to 2019. *This affects the common metrics* output.
* March 4, 2022 `ICSRFchinook2021.csv` and `ICSRSSchinookSurvey2020.csv` This fixed a metadata issue. The series column has the filename. Not used in analyses but helps us keep track of files. The series was changing instead of staying the same.
* March 4, 2022 `ICMCsthd2021.csv` No change just added a LF at end of file.
* March 3, 2022 No changes. They appear in the history but are part of the move of the 2020 data into data-raw.
* Jan 7, 2022 `PSSteelheadSR2020.csv` Fixed Carbon River fracwild. Should have been 1 not -99. Fixed East Hood and Skokomish fracwild for 2019. Should have been 1 not -99. *Note not in history for repo.*
